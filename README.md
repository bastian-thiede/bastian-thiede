### About me:
ðŸ”­ I'm working on a multi-user cross-platform experience. I'm aiming at bringing different disciplines together and merging the design tools/phase with the use phase.<br>ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm definitely learning something new every day ðŸ˜… However, I focus on infosec in particular atm.<br>ðŸ‘¯ I would be in on contributing to some os project.<br>ðŸ’¬ I'm always looking for tools that support my work or the work of my fellow scientists. Let me know what your cannot-miss-anymore is.
